# Arrhythmia Detection using Neural Networks and Topological Data Analysis

This project aims to detect arrhythmia using a combination of neural networks and topological 
data analysis. It is based on the [Topological Data Analysis for Arrhythmia Detection through Modular Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05795) by Meryll Dindin, Yuhei Umeda, and Frédéric Chazal.

## Description
Arrhythmia refers to abnormal heart rhythms that can lead to serious health issues. This project leverages the power of neural networks and topological data analysis to detect arrhythmia patterns in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. By extracting topological features from ECG data and training neural networks on these features, we aim to achieve accurate and efficient arrhythmia detection.

## Dependencies
The project is implemented in Python and requires the following libraries:
- scipy
- numpy
- bwr
- wfdb
- gudhi
- scikit-learn
